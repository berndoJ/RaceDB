# RaceDB

RaceDB is an open source, PHP-based race time evaluation web software.It can be used to
measure the race-time of the participants of a race.

It runs on a basic (L)AMP stack webserver and therefore only uses PHP and MySQL as a database.

The software features a login and user system as well as a run, relay and runner model.

## Intent

RaceDB was originally created for a race at Kollegium Kalksburg in Vienna. It is optimised for
the use at that specific race and can be modified and optimised for one's own needs.
